# Project2---Process-Monitoring-Using-Video-Analytics
Objective: Implement a vision system to monitor operator assembly processes and ensure thecorrect execution of steps.

1. System Architecture:
- Define the system architecture, considering the hardware and software components,including the Nvidia Jetson Nano and CCTV cameras.
  
2. . Video Analysis and Process Identification:
- Discuss the approach for analyzing the assembly process from video footage.
- Explain how video analytics and AI techniques can be used to identify and track theindividual steps in the process.
- Propose an algorithm or methodology to ensure the correctness of each step performed by the operator.
  
3. AI Training and Development:
- Describe the data collection process and annotation methodology for training the proces smonitoring model.
- Discuss the training pipeline and selection of appropriate deep learning frameworks/models for process identification.
- Explain the steps for training and validating the model using the collected dataset.
  
4. Deployment Planning:
- Outline the deployment strategy for the vision system on the Nvidia Jetson Nano/Xavier.
- Discuss any considerations or optimizations required for real-time performance.
- Address potential challenges or limitations in the deployment phase.
